## 🛠️ Build Instructions

To build and run the project locally
```bash
sbt compile &&
sbt run
```
The application ion will be available at 
```bash
http://localhost:9000
```

## 🚀 Features

- Core Reversi game logic
- Minimax algorithm with:
  - Heuristic scoring
  - Move tracking
  - Evaluation caching
- REST API to interface with backend logic 
- Future Plans
  - Implement front end and host in AWS
  - Support for machine-learning-driven heuristics
  - Database integration for persistent evaluation caching
  - Iterative deepening and move ordering optimizations

## 🌐 REST API

- The REST API is implemented using the [Scala Play Framework](https://www.playframework.com/)
- Endpoints are defined in `conf/routes`
- This is a work-in-progress and subject to change
- Below is a list of currently supported methods:

### 🧭 REST API Methods

| Method | Endpoint                             | Description                              |
|--------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| GET    | `/games/create-sample`               | Create a sample game                     |
| GET    | `/games/get-sample`                  | Retrieve a sample game                   |
| GET    | `/games/new-game`                    | Create a new game                        |
| GET    | `/games/:gameId`                     | Get full game state                      |
| GET    | `/games/:gameId/valid-moves/:player` | Get valid moves for a given player       |
| POST   | `/games/:gameId/move`                | Apply a human player's move              |
| GET    | `/games/:gameId/ai-move`             | Retrieve the AI's suggested move         |
| POST   | `/games/:gameId/ai-move`             | Apply the AI's move to the game board    |

### 📝 API Notes

- The game board is stored as a single string with `\n` as the delimiter separating rows.
- Valid moves are returned using [chess algebra notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_(chess)) (e.g., `E3`).
- Player tokens:
  - `'X'` → black pieces
  - `'O'` → white pieces
  - `' '` (space) → empty square
- The current player is tracked using the `currentTurn` field.


```scala
case class GameBoard(
  gameId: Long,              // Unique game identifier
  boardState: String,        // Serialized board state
  currentTurn: String,       // "X" or "O"
  lastMove: String           // Last move made by player or AI empty string for first move                  
  aiPlayer: String,          // "X" or "O" (if AI is participating) empty string if not
  isAIEnabled: Boolean       // Whether AI is enabled for the game
)
```
